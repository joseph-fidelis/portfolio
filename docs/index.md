# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

 
Hi, I'm Fidelis Uwem Joseph
I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building clean, scalable, and efficient systems using PHP (Laravel, SlimPHP), Python (FastAPI). Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve contributed to and led projects for startups and international teams, shipping robust APIs, automating business processes, and integrating cloud-native services.

I thrive in remote, asynchronous environments, and I enjoy solving complex challenges. Whether it's building a document signing microservice, customizing a WordPress plugin with Airtable automations, or deploying serverless workflows on GCP or AWS.

## What I Do

I specialize in designing and building systems, from API architecture and cloud deployment to automation and infrastructure management.

I enjoy working across the stack when needed, but my sweet spot is in solving tough backend challenges and integrating different platforms into one seamless experience.

- **[Mobile Development](/skill/mobile.md)**  
  I develop robust and intuitive cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter, Android with Kotlin, Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), and React Native. My focus is on crafting seamless user experiences while integrating mobile apps with scalable and efficient backend systems. I also build custom React Native libraries to extend native functionality and streamline app development across platforms.

- **[Backend Development](/skill/backend.md)**  
  I specialize in architecting and implementing scalable backend systems and APIs with PHP (Laravel, SlimPHP) and Python (FastAPI). My solutions emphasize security, maintainability, and high performance for modern web and mobile applications.

- **[Automations](/skill/automations.md)**  
  I design and implement automation workflows that streamline business processes, eliminate repetitive tasks, and boost operational efficiency. I leverage platforms like Make.com, Zapier, Google Apps Script, and Airtable Automations to connect services and orchestrate complex workflows. Additionally, I use Pythonâ€”with libraries like Seleniumâ€”to build custom scripts for browser automation, data scraping, and backend integrations when off-the-shelf solutions fall short.

- **[Library Specific Implementation](/skill/library.md)**  
  I create and customize software libraries and plugins tailored to specific project needs, with a focus on modularity, reusability, and seamless integration across platforms. My experience includes building UI-driven tools using NiceGUI and PyWebIO, generating dynamic documents with ReportLab, handling image processing with Pillow, and integrating interactive maps using Leaflet. These tools enable me to deliver robust solutions for dashboards, automation workflows, and geospatial applications with minimal overhead.
