## Welcome

Hi, I'm **Fidelis Uwem Joseph**  A Software Engineer specializing in the design and delivery of **enterprise-grade software systems** across mobile, web, backend, automation, and cloud infrastructure.

I work with organizations to build **secure, scalable, and maintainable platforms** using PHP (Laravel, SlimPHP), Python (FastAPI, Django), and modern mobile and frontend frameworks. My experience spans working with distributed teams, aligning engineering execution with business objectives, and delivering systems that support growth, compliance, and operational resilience.

I am experienced in **remote and asynchronous enterprise environments**, collaborating closely with product, engineering, and operations teams to deliver reliable solutions that integrate cleanly into existing technology ecosystems.

## What I Do

I help organizations **design, implement, and operate production systems** with an emphasis on:

* Architectural clarity and long-term maintainability
* System reliability, security, and performance
* Seamless integration across platforms and services
* Automation of operational and business workflows

I work comfortably across the full stack, where enterprise systems often face the greatest complexity.

## Mobile Engineering

**Flutter · React Native · Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) · Jetpack Compose**

I develop **enterprise-ready mobile applications** that meet high standards for performance, stability, and maintainability. My work includes:

* Building cross-platform mobile applications with **Flutter** and **React Native**
* Implementing shared business logic and SDKs using **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**
* Developing modern Android interfaces with **Jetpack Compose**
* Designing mobile architectures that align with backend domain models
* Creating custom native modules and internal libraries to extend platform capabilities

My mobile solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with enterprise backend systems and evolving infrastructure.

## Frontend Engineering

**Nuxt.js · Vue.js**

I build structured, maintainable frontend applications that support complex workflows and enterprise user requirements. This includes:

* Developing SPA and SSR applications using **Vue.js** and **Nuxt.js**
* Implementing component-driven and design-system–aligned architectures
* Integrating authentication, authorization, and enterprise APIs
* Optimizing performance, accessibility, and deployment pipelines

The focus is on **consistency, usability, and long-term sustainability** rather than short-term feature velocity.

## Backend & API Engineering

**Django · FastAPI · Laravel · SlimPHP**

Backend engineering is my core strength. I design systems that can operate reliably at scale while remaining adaptable to changing business needs. My experience includes:

* Designing and implementing RESTful and event-driven APIs
* Building modular monoliths and microservices architectures
* Implementing enterprise-grade security, authentication, and authorization
* Ensuring data integrity, observability, and fault tolerance
* Writing clean, well-documented, and testable codebases

I prioritize architectures that support **team scalability**, **system evolution**, and **operational transparency**.

## Automation & Systems Integration

**Make.com · Zapier · Google Apps Script · Airtable · Python**

I help enterprises reduce operational overhead by automating workflows and integrating disparate systems. My work includes:

* Designing multi-step automation pipelines across internal and third-party systems
* Orchestrating data flows using **Airtable Automations**
* Implementing custom logic with **Google Apps Script**
* Developing Python-based automation tools for:

  * API orchestration and backend jobs
  * Browser automation and data extraction
  * Custom integrations where no-code tools are insufficient

These solutions are designed to be **auditable, maintainable, and resilient** in production environments.

---

## DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure

**AWS · GCP · CI/CD · Serverless**

I support enterprise systems with reliable and repeatable infrastructure practices:

* Deploying and managing applications on **AWS** and **Google Cloud Platform**
* Designing **serverless and container-based architectures**
* Implementing CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and deployment
* Managing configuration, secrets, and environment isolation
* Ensuring logging, monitoring, and operational visibility

My DevOps approach focuses on **risk reduction, consistency, and operational maturity**.

---

## Internal Tools & Library Development

I design and build internal tools and libraries that improve developer productivity and operational efficiency, including:

* Reusable libraries and platform-specific plugins
* Internal dashboards and tooling using **NiceGUI** and **PyWebIO**
* Automated document generation with **ReportLab**
* Image processing workflows using **Pillow**
* Geospatial and mapping integrations with **Leaflet**

These tools are built with an emphasis on **reusability, governance, and maintainability**.
